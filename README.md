## Known Issues

As time was a constrant, there are some issues in the project that could certainly
be avoided in a working environment. Some of the identified / known issues in the 
project are:

1. Use of `thread.sleep` . Although used sparingly, it has been used. This can be avoided.
2. Code stying & abstraction can be better. I think there is scope for better encapsulation of code as well as naming conventions.
3. Test coverage could have been greater.

## Test Estimation and Plan document

- Here's a small Test Estimation and Plan document for a more wide ranging testing approach for Yatra's flight flow. This has been envisaged as a limited starting document which can be built upon depending on requirement.
